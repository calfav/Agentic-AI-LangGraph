## 📖 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered coding assistant** that mimics a **multi-agent development team**.  
It takes a **natural language request** and transforms it into a **complete, working project — file by file —** using real developer workflows.  

Built with **LangGraph**, the system demonstrates the power of **agentic AI** in software engineering automation.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture  
- **Planner Agent** → Analyzes requests and generates a detailed project plan  
- **Architect Agent** → Breaks down the plan into explicit engineering tasks for each file  
- **Coder Agent** → Implements tasks, writes into files, and uses tools like a real developer  

---

## 🎯 Features  
- Natural-language → **Complete project generation**  
- Modular **multi-agent architecture** with LangGraph  
- File-by-file **code generation & updates**  
- Supports **real developer workflows** (planning → architecture → coding)  
- Scalable and customizable for different project types  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.9+**  
- **LangGraph** for multi-agent orchestration  
- **LangChain / LLMs** for natural language understanding  
- **Jupyter Notebook / CLI** for experimentation  
- Optional integrations: GitHub Actions, containerization  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Installation  
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-ai-coding-assistant.git
cd agentic-ai-coding-assistant

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App  
```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 📊 Example Usage  
Input (natural language request):  
```
Build me a To-Do app with user authentication and task categories
```  

Output (AI-generated project):  
- `/app.py` (main app logic)  
- `/auth.py` (user authentication)  
- `/tasks.py` (task CRUD operations)  
- `/templates/` (UI templates)  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Expand with more **specialized agents** (e.g., Tester Agent, Debugger Agent)  
- Integration with **GitHub repos & CI/CD**  
- Support for **multi-language projects** (Python, JS, etc.)  
- Built-in **evaluation metrics** for generated code quality
